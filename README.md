# Basic operation
> This is the code for "Citywide Cellular Traffic Prediction Based on Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Networks".

Users can run "demo_densenet.py" to train the model and the results will be generated and stored in the reporsitory.

If you just want to see the prediction reseults without time to run the code, you can simply run "run_prediction.py", and you will also obtain the results.

# Data
The data can be downloaded at [my web](https://chuanting.github.io/data/data.zip).

The paper can be found at [this link](https://chuanting.github.io/pdf/ieee_cl_2018.pdf).

An executable code can also be found at [codeocean](https://codeocean.com/capsule/3301293/tree/v1).

# Update 2019/06/03
The code is written by using PyTorch 0.3 and for PyTorch version > 1.0, it can not be executed successfully. I update the code and if there still exists bugs, please email me directly.
